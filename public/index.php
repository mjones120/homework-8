//2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
//PHP is a server-side scripting library while javascript is a client side scripting language. PHP additionally supports databases while javascript doesn't. Both languages use script and help build web pages
//3. Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?
//MVC is a design pattern that separates the application into 3 different logical components: Model, View, and Controller.
// The controller enables interconnection between the view and the model. 
//The view is used for UI logic as it generates the user interface. 
//The mdoel corresponds with the data-related logic that user works with. It represents the data that is being transferred between the view and hte controller
